					Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
					project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join
					is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
					<h3>What is Join?</h3>
					Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
					group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp
					at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
					"billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
					work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages
					the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
					in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that Join
					is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
					extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
					user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
					reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
					<h3>How to use it</h3>
					Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
							When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
							represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
							"In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
							In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
							to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
							required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
							tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Adding Cards</h4>
							Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
							Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
							appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
							the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Moving Cards</h4>
							As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
							on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
							another.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
							Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
							list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
							the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
							action is irreversible.
						</li>
					</ol>

					Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from
					you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of
					your project. Have more questions about Join? Feel free to contact us
					at [Your Contact Email]. We're here to help you!

					<h3>Enjoy using Join!</h3>
